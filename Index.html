        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of
            melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies.
            General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony),
            rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness),
            and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical
            sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements.
            Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to
            rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental
            accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We will help you learn different instruments so that you can do what you
            want in life.A musical instrument is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle,
            any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrumentâ€”it is through purpose that the
            object becomes a musical instrument. A person who plays a musical instrument is known as an
            instrumentalist. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early
            musical instruments may have been used for rituals, such as a horn to signal success on the hunt, or a
            drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for
            entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of
            music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of
            the music, such as the notes of a melody, are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions
            on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow
            blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre. To read music notation, a person must
            have an understanding of music theory, harmony and the performance practice associated with a particular
            song or piece's genre.
