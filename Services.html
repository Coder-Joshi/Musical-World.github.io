        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Bollywood songs, more formally known as Hindi Geet or filmi songs, are songs featured in Bollywood films. Derived from the song-and-dance routines common in Indian films, Bollywood songs, along with dance, are a characteristic motif of Hindi cinema which gives it enduring popular appeal, cultural value and context.Hindi film songs form a predominant component of Indian pop music, and derive their inspiration from both classical and modern sources.Hindi film songs are now firmly embedded in North India's popular culture and routinely encountered in North India in marketplaces, shops, during bus and train journeys and numerous other situations.Though Hindi films routinely contain many songs and some dance routines, they are not musicals in the Western theatrical sense

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Pop Songs</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Pop is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced.Identifying factors usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format,and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">We well help you learn music</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of
            music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of
            the music, such as the notes of a melody, are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions
            on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow
            blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre. To read music notation, a person must
            have an understanding of music theory, harmony and the performance practice associated with a particular
            song or piece's genre.
